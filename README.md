# Responsive web

## Description

This is a responsive web project built using HTML and CSS, and following the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology. The project is designed to be easily viewable and accessible on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

The purpose of this project is to showcase the ability to create a website that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly while adhering to best practices for web development. The use of the BEM methodology ensures that the HTML and CSS code is clean, maintainable, and easy to understand.

The website includes various sections, such as a navigation menu, a main section, an aside section and a footer. The layout is responsive, meaning it adapts to the size of the screen it is viewed on, and the design is visually appealing, with a clean and modern look.

This project can be used as a starting point for building similar websites or as a reference for learning best practices for web development using HTML and CSS with the BEM methodology.
